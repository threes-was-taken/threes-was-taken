# 👋 Hi

My name is Dries Verelst.  
I'm interested in the Full Stack experience but I'm leaning towards the backend.  
In the backend, my interests lie with testing (Jest), APIs and Authentication/Authorization.  
In my spare time I practice freestyle snowboarding and climbing (bouldering) 🏂 🧗  
I currently work as a Full Stack Web developer at [Unikoo](https://www.unikoo.be/en).

Some fun facts:
- I ended up 2nd in the .NET challenge of [Hack The Future](https://www.hackthefuture.be/home) 2020 👨‍💻
- I have 2 dogs, Bonnie and Clyde. 🐕
