# 👋 Hi

My name is Dries Verelst.  
I'm interested in the Full Stack experience but I'm leaning towards the backend.  
In the backend, my interests lie with testing (Jest), APIs and the Serverless framework and everything that entails (AWS, Lambda,...).  
In my spare time I practice climbing (bouldering) 🧗  
I'm starting as an open source contributor.  
I currently work as a Full Stack Web developer at [Unikoo](https://www.unikoo.be/en).

Some fun facts:
- I ended up 2nd in the .NET challenge of [Hack The Future](https://www.hackthefuture.be/home) 2020 👨‍💻
- I have 2 dogs, Bonnie and Clyde. 🐕
